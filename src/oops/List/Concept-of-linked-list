What is linked List ??
Ans: Linked List is a part of the Collection framework present in java.util package.
     This class is an implementation of the LinkedList data structure which is a linear
     data structure where the elements are not stored in contiguous locations and every
     element is a separate object with a data part and address part. The elements are
     linked using pointers and addresses. Each element is known as a node.

     Points: 1) In linked list element are not stored in continuous fashion.
             2) Size is not fixed it change dynamically as item added or remove
             3)
